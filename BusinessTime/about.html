        <h1>What is Party Packed?</h1>
        <p>Party Packed started as a mom with a low budget who wanted to make her kids feel extra special on their
            birthday by letting them choose the theme they wanted and letting her creativity flow as she crafted
            handmade items for their birthday parties. This sparked so much joy in her that she decided to share the fun
            and special experience with everyone.</p>
